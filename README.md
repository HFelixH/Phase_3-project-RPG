# Every hero begins their journey stuck in a dungeon!
Follow the text prompts and venture through the dungeons.

Test your luck! Everything is about chance!

"s - search" the dungeon for the key to escape, but beware of monsters!

"m -move" to the next dungeon or you might be lucky and find the exit!

Fight monsters! with "a -attack", but keep an eye on your Health Point (HP).

Find that key and escape and don't die along the way!

To begin; run ruby game.rb

# Good Luck!
